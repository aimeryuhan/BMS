** This is a 4th year Capstone Project developed by UofT students **

** Project Description **
This Battery Management System (BMS) project involves the development of monitoring, protection, charging, communication and user interface circuits to optimize the operation of a battery pack. The BMS will be designed to accommodate a battery array consists of multiple Li-ion battery cells connected in series and in parallel. The focus is to provide continuous monitoring on the state of health and charge of the individual cells and the battery pack as a whole. The BMS will also take decisive action on how to optimum the power delivery capability of the battery pack.

** Contents of this Repo **
The capstone team uses Git as the version control platform mainly for Altium Designer PCB schematic and layout. Codes for communication & control and GUI development are welcomed to be merged into the repo.
